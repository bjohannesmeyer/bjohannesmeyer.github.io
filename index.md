Hi, I'm Brian! I’m a PhD candidate at [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), fascinated by all things systems security. I enjoy discovering and mitigating software weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

## Research Interests

I build tools that automatically identify vulnerabilities and generate exploits.
I’m especially into systems security, operating systems, and program analysis—basically, finding ways to break (and then fix) software in creative ways.
